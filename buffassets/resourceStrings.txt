//BuffManual_Summary
BuffManual_Summary_Content_0|RandomBuff is a game mode that is played with randomized gain effect pairings. You can add challenges for yourself or complete special missions to unlock rewards.
//BuffManual_Gamemode
BuffManual_GameMode_Content_0|There are two modes of random buff, divided into normal mode and mission mode.
BuffManual_GameMode_Content_1|The most conventional way to play the game.<LINE>If you succeed in making a settlement, you will only settle the experience value to level up based on the completed conditions, number of kills and number of cards held.<LINE>Sub-modes can be switched in the lower left corner of the interface.
BuffManual_GameMode_Content_2|You can choose from 0 to 5 conditions to play, each successful rain sleep will be drawn in a round, and the rain sleep will be settled when all conditions are completed. <LINE>No settlement will be made at 0 conditions. <LINE>Depending on the slug cat selected, the initial room is the same as the initial room of the selected slug cat in Campaign Mode.
BuffManual_GameMode_Content_3|The conditions are selected in the same way as normal mode, but a completely randomized draw will be made every 30 seconds. <LINE>The earliest drawn buff will be automatically removed when the number of cards exceeds a certain number.<LINE>The initial room will be randomly selected from all shelters in the current area.
BuffManual_GameMode_Content_4|Conditions are selected in the same way as normal mode. However, you can choose a certain number of initial buffs when you start the game, and every time you go through a rain cycle after that, an additional negative buff will be added.<LINE>The initial rooms are selected in the same way as in Quick Mode.
BuffManual_GameMode_Content_5|The mode of fixed conditions and initial gains is divided into generic missions and exclusive missions. <LINE>Exclusive missions can only be completed by specific slug cats, while general missions can be completed by any slug cat. <LINE>Completing missions not only allows you to level up as in Free Mode, but also unlocks special collectibles!
