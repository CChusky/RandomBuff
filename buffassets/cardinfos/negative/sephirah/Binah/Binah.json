        "Description":"Spawn Binah in the room. After defeating her, the card is automatically destroyed and three random positive buffs are given. \nSkill Description: 1. Triggered once every 150s, chains are generated in random rooms, and resistance is increased to 10 times. Breaking the chains can reduce resistance. If all chains are not removed before the next trigger, the corresponding icon creatures will be generated at the chain position, and random creatures will be generated in the room where the player is. 2. Trigger a key attack every once in a while, randomly aiming at a player and stunning the creature passing through. If passing through a pipe, a random creature will be generated at the pipe. 3. Trigger a fairy attack every once in a while. The screen flashes three times before triggering. Use demon attacks on all players in the room (not through walls) and cause long-term stun. 4. Permanent effect: Randomly let the creature go to the player's room, block the karma portal, and slow down the player's speed"
